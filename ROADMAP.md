# Feature and Maintenance Roadmap

This project's initial roadmap is based on three principles:

- Backwards compatability with `mapbox-gl-js` as published in v1.13.
- Continue maintenance and bug fixes of the v1 codebase.
- New features and improvements in additional, future releases.

## Release v1.13

A working, drop-in replacement for existing codebases using `mapbox-gl-js`. This allows users to switch without concern of breakage.

## Release v1.14

- Remove any Mapbox-specific code, including `mapbox://` URI support, access-token support, amoung other things. A compatability library will be provided to aid the transition.
- Improve support for additional bindings, such as Vue, React, and other framework plugins.

## And beyond.

Futher plans will be outlined at a later time.
